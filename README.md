# TikTok-Algorithm
Code for generating Tiktok X-Gorgon, X-Khronos and etc. parameters, also containing some older examples on how to use the TikTok API.

This code was not written by me.

This code was last tested and worked on Nov 20, 2021.

I was able to construct a new and working tiktok api using these algorithims (for getting video information): https://github.com/frogc0de/TikTok-API
