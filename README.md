# TikTok-Algorithm
I found this python file from a source which was later deleted. Although the test api functions no longer seem to work, surprisingly the X-Gorgon, X-Khronos and etc. parameter generation works perfectly fine after testing it. The generation of these parameters is very important for being able to make requests to the tiktok api which is why I decided to post this code.

Using this code I was able to construct a new tiktok api which is able to fetch information about videos, but other functions can be added as well: https://github.com/frogc0de/TikTok-API
